# ArganRegogn : Face Recognition Using Convolutional Neural Nets
========================

In this work we have used a large scale dataset, with small label noise,
while keeping down the number of manual annotation. The main idea was
to train a classifier to rank the data presented to the annotators.
This procedure has been developed for faces, but is evidently suitable for
other object classes as well as fine grained tasks. Then as another contribution
we have showed that a well trained deep convolutional neural network can achieve
very good results comparing to the state of the art.Ë™
